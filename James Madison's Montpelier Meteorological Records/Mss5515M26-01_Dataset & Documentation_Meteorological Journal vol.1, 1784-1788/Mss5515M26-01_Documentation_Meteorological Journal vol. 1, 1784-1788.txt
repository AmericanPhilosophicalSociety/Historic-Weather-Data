Data description:
This dataset contains the information from volume 2 (1784- 1788) and is fully interoperable with Mss5515M26-01 (1784-1788). The manuscript entries were originally transcribed into database/tabular form by Dr. Daniel Druckenbrod. His organization scheme and annotations remain in the columns 'Druckenbrod Sort ID' and 'Druckenbrod Notes'. With the permission of Dr. Druckenbrod, these datasets were reviewed, edited, and restructured when necessary to ensure interoperability with similar datasets being created at UVA from Thomas Jefferson's weather records. Specific alterations are noted in the "Normalization and Data Standards" section of this documentation. These changes as well as other notes from the process at APS are found in each dataset's 'APS Notes' column.

Each row has been assigned a numerical ID ('Sort ID') to allow sorting while preserving the data's context.

Temperature is recorded in Fahrenheit, and any volume is recorded in inches.


Column structure and contents:
This documentation is extensive and can be found in the accompanying JSON file.


Damage and Lost Data:
Some entries in the journals were not filled. They have been entered in this spreadsheet, but their blankness is noted in the 'APS Notes' column. Entries in the manuscript that were crossed out have been excluded.


Assumptions:
Dittos (Do.) are silently corrected and assumed to refer to the information in the above row. The 'Observer Data' column was copied from the Druckenbrod et al. description without editing. However, while we can assume that James Madison, Jr. (1751-1836) or James Madison, Sr. (1723-1801) recorded the vast majority of this data, we are not able at present to decisively identify the specific individual who recorded the entries at any given point in time.


Normalization and Data Standards:
Date is separated into year, month, date. Transcribed comments are generally not normalized, unless damage, foxing, and ink stains make some letters difficult to interpret. Wind direction, time, and temperature high time taken have all been standardized in their “data” columns in modern notation.

Caveat Emptor:
These datasets were created as part of the American Philosophical Society's Open Data Initiative (Learn more at http://diglib.amphilsoc.org/data).
Although contributors took care to minimize mistakes and inconsistencies in the creation of these items, and have included any assumptions or choices made on their part that may affect interoperability or integrity of the data, APS cannot guarantee that they are free of instances of human error. They are offered "as is," and researchers are encouraged to consult the original records in digital or physical format in the event of uncertainty.
