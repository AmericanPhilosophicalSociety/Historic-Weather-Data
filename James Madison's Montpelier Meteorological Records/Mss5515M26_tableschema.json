However, some noted wind directions (e.g., 'veering and unsettled') present no quantitative data on wind direction, and thus have been excluded from this column and noted as 'null data in wind direction' in the APS notes column. Additionally, partway through this volume, the Madisons abandoned most variations on compass directions in favor of noting two-to-four letters split into two levels within the manuscript (e.g., 'NE/NW,' 'S/SW').
